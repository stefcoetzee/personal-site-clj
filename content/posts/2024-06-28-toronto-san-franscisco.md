# Toronto vs. San Francisco

Until recently I was quite unaware of the tech scene in Toronto.
Studio 535 and other spaces are playing instrumental roles in spreading
awareness of the local goings on in all things software and internet business.

One thing that seems immediately obvious to me is the degree to which ambition
is celebrated.
Most places _tolerate_ ambition.
The Bay Area appears to _celebrate_ it, instead.

## El Segundo?

El Segundo has emerged as a growing tech hub, particularly with aerospace and defense tech companies. The presence of major players like SpaceX and The Aerospace Corporation has created a unique ecosystem where innovation in space tech meets traditional software development.

## Austin?

Austin's tech scene combines Texas affordability with California-style innovation. Companies like Tesla, Oracle, and numerous startups have made Austin their home, creating a vibrant tech community that balances work-life integration with technological advancement.

## Pittsburgh?

Pittsburgh leverages its strong academic foundation from CMU and Pitt to foster AI and robotics innovation. The city's transformation from industrial heavyweight to tech hub showcases how traditional manufacturing expertise can evolve into cutting-edge technology development.

## Provo?

Provo's "Silicon Slopes" represents Utah's growing tech presence, with a focus on SaaS and enterprise software. The combination of a young, educated workforce from BYU and a business-friendly environment has created a thriving tech ecosystem.

## New York?

New York City's tech scene uniquely intersects with finance, media, and advertising. The city offers a different flavor of tech innovation, where startups and established companies solve problems for some of the world's largest industries, all while leveraging the city's unparalleled network effects.
